This folder consists of three demo datasets (Demo1, Demo2, and Demo3) from LC-MS-based metabolomic studies. 

Demo1 and Demo2 consist of a small subset of peaks detected in a metabolomic study using LC-MS in the positive mode. Since these two demo datasets have relatively fewer m/z values compared to the original dataset, they can be used to test MetaboCraft quickly. On the other hand, Demo3 includes the entire set of detected peaks n metabolomic study using LC-MS in the negative mode. For each of the three demo datasets, both the original and CAMERA-processed data are provided. 

MetaboCraft detects automatically if the uploaded data are CAMERA-processed or not. However, the user should select the "ionization" mode before submitting the data for analysis by MetaboCraft.
